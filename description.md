# Planets of the Inner Solar System (error < 1.3%) - 42179 alt

## Properties

This planetary model ("orrery") shows the inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars - orbiting the Sun.

It can be built from just the pieces of set 42179 (Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit)

The model has a relatively accurate representation of the orbital periods of the planets. Relative to Earth, the durations of one rotation around the sun have these errors:

* Mercury: +0.5%
* Venus: -1.3%
* Mars: +0.5%

The distances from the sun are also approximately to scale.

## Design and Future Improvements

This model shows a viable, basic system that can be expanded upon - for more complex / more aestethic future models.

With some extra pieces it should be possible to have bigger and colored planets, and to get the maximum error down to 0.2%. This is something I'm planning to do in the future.

If you're interested in expanding upon this design, feel free to do so and also feel free to get in contact.
